> Project Information
In this project I had to update and improve a programme of code.
I had to follow the instructions given and update and streamline the code so it was more efficient.

The programme is a task manager. The user is asked to input information such as Usernames, Passwords and other relative info.
The user can assign tasks with their descriptions and also deadlines. This can be for themselves or other people.
All they need to do is create an account for each individual along with a password.

The user can view their own tasks and tasks that are still in need of completing.
The programme can also run statistic infomation and generate reports.


> Installation
Please remember this is in Python, so please use accordingly.

On Github.com, navigate to the main page of this repository.
Above the list of files, click <<code>>
Click download zip. This then should allow you to have a copy of this code to then impliment into your IDE.


> Usage
First things first - You will be promted to input your user name & password (see below)

Then you will be prompted by a menu.  You have a multiple choice selection here, but for simplicity sake I will go through each one by one.
When you select your choice with the correct corrosponding key e.g. "r" for "registering a new user" you will be prompted with a screen like this.

When I select "r" I will be promted by a screen that asks for the following information. A new username, a password & then conformation of that password.

Once this is completed the menu will reappear. This will be the case every time, and will continue unless you select "e" to Exit.

Next for adding a task, option "a". The programme will ask you who you would like to assign the task to. This can also be for yourself.
It'll ask the title of the task. Here I've chosen "Fred", I've called their task title "Music" and in the description I've told them to "Write 5 new songs".
As you can see below you also have the option of choosing the due date. I've given the genorous date of 12th April 2036 for Fred to get this task done.
However you must write the date as year, dash, month, dash, date. (YYYY-MM-DD) so it would be 2036-04-12. You then recieve a conformation message.

View all, option "va". This shows you every users current tasks and information of the tasks.

View My Tasks, option "vm". This will show you only YOUR tasks and their descriptions. 
***Image Section***
When selecting the task you want with the correct corrosponding number, you will be prompted with a new menu with 3 options.
Option 1 - Mark as Complete - Simply marks the task as complete
Option 2 - Change the Due Date - Gives you the option to ajust the due date to your preffered date
Option 3 - Change the Assigned User - Gives you the option to switch the task to a different/new user.
