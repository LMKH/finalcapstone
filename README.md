Line ... Project Information

In this project I had to update and improve a programme of code.
I had to follow the instructions given and update and streamline the code so it was more efficient.

The programme is a task manager. The user is asked to input information such as Usernames, Passwords and other relative info.
The user can assign tasks with their descriptions and also deadlines. This can be for themselves or other people.
All they need to do is create an account for each individual along with a password.

The user can view their own tasks and tasks that are still in need of completing.
The programme can also run statistic infomation.
